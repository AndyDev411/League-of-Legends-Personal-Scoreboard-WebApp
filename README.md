# League of Legends Personal Scoreboard Website

LoL Personal Scoreboard Website was a project made becuase there was no direct 
way to compare your skills side by side with your friends or other favorite players.
So I developed this web app using React, and the Riot Games API. Lol Personal Scoreboard
scores players based on their League Points gained per Hour, the displays them side by side
for you to compare. Very Straight forward but I really just wanted a reason to use the Riot
API besides making an op.gg clone...
